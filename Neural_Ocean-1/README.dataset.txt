The project aims to develop an image processing solution for detecting underwater debris and garbage using the **Yolo V8** deep learning algorithm. The images used for this project will be preprocessed to remove noise using the Dark Channel Prior approach described in the research paper "**Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior**" by Kaiming He, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang.[Link to the Research Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567108&isnumber=6047995)
